# JavaAssignment4
Not only was this my final coding assignment of high school, but this was also my final assignment of high school.  Crazy, right?  This is one of my longer programs, and it takes in customer information from 20 customers, adds it to the array, and sorts it based on postal code.  It'll also let the user search by postal district and postal district and local delivery unit (for more information on that, see the Canadian Postal Code System, which this was based off of).  Hardest part was getting the year to verify properly, the postal code to verify, and the sort, since I was missing a break statement that took me forever to find.  Regardless, I'm super happy with how this project turned out, and it was a great way to end off my high school career.  Now back to studying for my calculus exam :)
